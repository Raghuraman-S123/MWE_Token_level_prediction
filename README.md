# MWE_Token_level_prediction

Contains the code for workshop paper " Token-level Identification of Multiword Expressions using Pre-Trained Multilingual Language Models "

For SemEval task:

1.  There are 3 notebooks for each model Run the code and get the CSV file containing the output. 
2.  To get the results, upload your csv onto the competiton website https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/8121 
3.  The results for this experiments is already there in the results folder under the folder named "Semeval"
4.  The link to the baseline in the paper is https://sites.google.com/view/semeval2022task2-idiomaticity containing the baseline and original datasets.

 
For Parseme task:


1.  Download the dataset from https://gitlab.com/parseme/sharedtask-data/-/tree/master/1.2 . For the original dataset without modifications, Copy the files onto the parseme/parseme1.2/data/1.2/.
2.  For the additional settings, run the code blocks under the "multilingual setting", these contain the commands to create the new datasets. First you would need to create a folder under the setting name, then copy all the train,dev and test files from each language for each new setting.
3.  There is one notebook Run the dependencies. Run the config files for each settings by running the command. 
4.  The results for average are in the notebook.
5.  The link to the MTLB-STRUCT repo is https://github.com/shivaat/MTLB-STRUCT
